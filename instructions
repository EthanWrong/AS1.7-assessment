Version 1:

This quiz is a whole-word answer quiz that tests your knowledge of the\n
Maori language and helps you to improve.\n
After selecting the words you wish to learn and the language you wish to\n
answer in, you will continue translating words until you have translated\n
all the words you selected.\n
Once you have finished translating words, you will be able to review your\n
stats and mistakes.\n
\n
NOTES:\n
  When choosing a language, you can choose 'both' if you wish to answer in\n
   Maori and English.\n
  When translating, enter 'x' if you wish to stop the quiz there.\n


Version 2:

This word-translation will help you learn some Maori words.\n
\n
First you will select which categories of words you wish to learn. You can\n
 choose ().\n
\n
Next, you will choose which language you wish to answer in: Maori, English,\n
 or Both\n
\n
Then the game will start, and you will be asked to translate words into
 your chosen language until you have either translated them all, or you\n
 stop the game by entering 'x'\n
\n
Every time you get a question wrong, it will be recorded as a mistake and\n
 you will be given two more of that same question (practice makes\n
 perfect). To help you, the game will also give you all the possible\n
 answers\n
\n
Many words have multiple different answers for each language:\n
 In Maori, there are usually a couple different translations which are\n
  valid, and answering without macrons is also valid\n
 In English, you can answer with the first three letters of the days and\n
  months, and just the numeral for numbers\n
 (Remember, making mistakes is how you learn, so make sure you check all\n
 the other possible answers that work if you get one wrong)\n
\n
At the end of the game you will see your stats such as questions\n
 right/wrong and how fast you were at answering them. You will also have\n
 the option to review your mistakes and see all the questions you got\n
 wrong.\n
\n
Finally, you will be given your 'Word to Revise'--this is the word you got\n
 wrong the most, so practice it!\n
